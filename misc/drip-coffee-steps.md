# Protocol documentation for coffee-tasting experiments

## Random assignment

For take 1:   
- balanced, completely randomized design
- subject knows that it's balanced and completely randomized
- Outcomes: subject's IDs of which cup comes from which batch

## Preparation of "samples"

- Use metal thermos (One of which has plastic top; try to keep it upright)
- Pre-heat w/ near-boiling water
- Before serving, use infrared temp gun to compare measure temperatures
- Allow hotter coffee to cool to match temp of cooler coffee
- Get temperatures w/in ?? degrees Fahrenheit of one another

## BH home brewing coffee procedure


- Obtain freshly roasted coffee beans. (I get mine from Roos Roast; in this case, Malawi Chipale Estate, roasted 7/20)

- Use burr grinder to grind beans. (I use a Cuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill, set to Medium)
- Weigh ground beans; pour 1 cup water/10g beans into coffee maker.

- Separately, bring 2 cups water to boil.  Pour 1 cup through coffee filter, another cup directly into coffee canister.

- Prepare coffee via drip method, stirring a couple times . (I use a Techivorm Moccamaster.)

- Pre-warm thermos w/ near-boiling water; dump the water, pour coffee into thermos.
