## BH home brewing coffee procedure


- Obtain freshly roasted coffee beans. (I get mine from Roos Roast; in this case, Malawi Chipale Estate, roasted 7/20)

- Use burr grinder to grind beans. (I use a Cuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill, set to Medium)
- Weigh ground beans; pour 1 cup water/10g beans into coffee maker.

- Separately, bring 2 cups water to boil.  Pour 1 cup through coffee filter, another cup directly into coffee canister.

- Prepare coffee via drip method, stirring a couple times . (I use a Techivorm Moccamaster.)

- Pre-warm thermos w/ near-boiling water; dump the water, pour coffee into thermos.
