# Introduction
- Who am I?
- My ideas about teaching statistics as a creative endeavor and language of power:
   - **Practice theory**: Minimize lectures, maximize practice with concepts and techniques, computer and software as an instrument of exploration, reading to raise questions and introduce concepts to aid in-class conversation.
   - Student centered: Happy to spend time talking about your questions and ideas rather than working on exercises.
- Who are y'all?


# Proposed Plan for Week 1

## Day 1

Make a matched design.

## Day 2
When to stop matching? Hansen and Sales 2015 and grid search.

## Day 3
Estimation of the ATE. Unbiasedness in the simple and weighted cases.  Bias in Logit coefficients for the difference in log-odds.  Standard errors. Coverage. Type I error rate.

## Day 4
Diff in Diffs, Covariance adjustment for matched designs.  Maybe power and power analysis.  Instrumental variables including CACE

## Day 5
Longitudinal designs

# Proposed Plan for Week 2

## Day 6
Non-Bipartite matching for treatment/interventions that are continous.

## Day 7
Sensitivity analysis: Rosenbaum style

## Day 8
Sensitivity analysis: Hosman, Hansen, Holland style

## Day 9

Approaches to interference.


# Today: Make a Matched Design
